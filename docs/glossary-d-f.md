| **Ensemble Forecast**          | A forecasting method that uses multiple model runs with slightly varied initial conditions to improve accuracy.                                       | Forecasting Parameter     |
| **Excessive Rainfall Outlook** | (Abbrev. ERO) A WPC product showing the probability of rainfall exceeding flash flood guidance within 25 miles of a point.                            | WPC Product               |
| **Eyewall**                    | The ring of intense thunderstorms surrounding the eye of a hurricane, where the strongest winds and heaviest rain occur.                              | Tropical Meteorology      |
| **Flash Flood**                | A sudden and dangerous surge of water into a normally dry area, often from heavy rain, dam failure, or rapid runoff.                                  | Severe Weather Phenomenon |
| **Front**                      | A boundary separating two air masses of differing density, usually involving a temperature difference.                                                | General Meteorology       |
| **Fujita Scale**               | (F Scale) A scale that categorizes tornadoes based on estimated wind speeds inferred from damage.                                                     | Tornado Rating System     |
