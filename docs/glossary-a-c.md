|-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| AC | Abbreviation for Altocumulus – a cloud characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus. Medium altitude (8,000 – 20,000 ft) | Acronym |
| Accessory Cloud | A cloud dependent on a larger cloud system for development and continuance. Roll clouds, shelf clouds, and wall clouds are all examples. | SC & Field Ops |
| Accretion | The growth of a particle of precipitation by the collision of a frozen particle with a supercooled liquid water droplet that freezes on impact. |  |
| ACLD | Above Cloud Level | Acronym |
| Adiabat | A line on thermodynamic charts relating to the pressure and temperature of a substance (air) that is undergoing a transformation in which no heat is exchanged with its environment. | Thermodynamics |
| Adiabatic Process | The process by which no exchange of heat occurs between a system and its environment. | Thermodynamics |
| Advection | (Abbrev. ADVCTN) The transport of an atmospheric property by the wind. | Acronym |
| Advisory | (Abbrev. ADVY) Highlights special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning. | Acronym |
| Air Mass | A body of air covering a relatively wide area and exhibiting horizontally uniform properties. | Thermodynamics |
| AIRMET | Airman’s Meteorological Advisory (WA) | Acronym |
| Alberta Clipper | A fast-moving low-pressure system that moves southeast out of southwestern Canada through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes region of the U.S. usually during the winter. Sometimes called the “Saskatchewan Screamer”. | Geographically Associated |
| Aleutian Low | A semi-permanent area of low pressure located in the Gulf of Alaska near the Aleutian Islands. This area generates storms and migratory lows. | Geographically Associated |
| Altimeter | An instrument that indicates the altitude of an object above a fixed level. |  |
| Altostratus | A cloud of a class characterized by uniform or gray sheet or layer-like clouds. Medium altitude (8,000 – 20,000 ft.) |  |
| Ambient | Referring to the surrounding area or environment. |  |
| AMS | American Meteorological Society | Acronym |
| Anemometer | An instrument used to measure the speed of wind. |  |
| Anomalous Propagation | Non-standard atmospheric temperature or moisture gradience causing the radar beam to propagate along a non-normal path. When abnormal downward bending occurs, it’s called “superrefraction”. | Radar Feature |
