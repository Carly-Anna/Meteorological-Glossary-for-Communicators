| **Meteorological Term** | **Description**                                                                                                                                           | **Category**          |

| **J/kg**                | Joules per kilogram; a unit used to measure atmospheric instability such as CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) and CIN (Convective Inhibition). | Thermodynamics        |
| **Jet**                 | A fast-moving wind current in the atmosphere, typically found in the upper levels, surrounded by slower-moving air.                                       | General Meteorology   |
| **Jet Streak**          | Also called the "jet max"; a location of maximum wind speed within a jet stream.                                                                          | Forecasting Parameter |
| **Lapse Rate**          | The rate at which atmospheric temperature changes with height. Steeper lapse rates typically indicate increasing instability.                             | Thermodynamics        |
| **Leeside Low**         | An extratropical cyclone that forms on the downwind (lee) side of a mountain range, such as the eastern side of the Rockies.                              | Forecasting Parameter |
| **Leeward**             | The side of a terrain feature that is sheltered from the prevailing wind.                                                                                 | General Meteorology   |
| **Left Exit Region**    | The area downstream and to the left of a jet streak maximum. Known for upward motion and potential storm development.                                     | Forecasting Parameter |
| **Left Mover**          | A thunderstorm that deviates left from the mean wind flow, usually the n                                                                                  |                       |
