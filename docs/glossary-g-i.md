| **GFS**                 | Global Forecast System. An operational model run at NCEP four times daily, producing forecasts out to 384 hours.                                  | Forecast Model            |
| **GEFS**                | Global Ensemble Forecast System. A forecasting model composed of 21 ensemble members used to improve prediction accuracy.                         | Forecast Model            |
| **Ground Clutter**      | Radar echoes from fixed ground targets near the radar. Ground clutter can obscure or be mistaken for precipitation echoes near the antenna.       | Radar Feature             |
| **Gust Front**          | The leading edge of cool outflow winds from a thunderstorm downdraft.                                                                             | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Gustnado**            | A small, short-lived whirlwind occurring along a gust front; not connected to cloud rotation and not considered a tornado.                        | Severe Weather Phenomenon |
| **Hail Spike**          | A radar reflectivity feature extending outward from the radar behind a storm with very large hail. Indicates large, highly reflective hailstones. | Radar Feature             |
| **Heat Index**          | Also known as “apparent temperature”; combines air temperature and relative humidity to estimate how hot it feels to humans.                      | General Meteorology       |
| **Hodograph**           | A polar coordinate diagram displaying the vertical wind profile up to 7,000 meters. Used to assess wind shear and storm type potential.           | Forecasting Tool          |
| **Hook Echo**           | A hook-shaped radar reflectivity pattern in the rear flank of a storm, often associated with mesocyclones and potential tornado formation.        | Radar Feature             |
| **HP Storm**            | High-Precipitation Supercell. A supercell with heavy precipitation that often obscures rotation or tornadoes from visual observation.             | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Inflow Bands**        | Bands of low clouds aligned with low-level winds, feeding into a developing thunderstorm.                                                         | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Inflow Notch**        | A V-shaped indentation on radar reflectivity showing where warm, moist air is entering the storm—often associated with severe thunderstorms.      | Radar Feature             |
| **Isobar**              | A line on a weather map connecting locations with equal atmospheric pressure.                                                                     | General Meteorology       |
