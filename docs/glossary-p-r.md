| **PDS**                        | *Particularly Dangerous Situation* — A high-alert wording used during rare and severe weather events, such as long-lived, strong to violent tornadoes. May also be applied to severe thunderstorm or fire weather watches. | Acronym                   |
| **Pre-Frontal Squall Line**    | A line of thunderstorms that develops ahead of an advancing cold front.                                                                                                                                                    | Forecasting Parameter     |
| **Propagation**                | The movement of an atmospheric phenomenon, typically referring to thunderstorms shifting into areas that support continued development.                                                                                    | General Meteorology       |
| **Quasi-Stationary Front**     | A front that remains nearly stationary or shows very little movement compared to its last analyzed position.                                                                                                               | General Meteorology       |
| **Radar**                      | *RAdio Detection And Ranging* — A system that detects and measures the location and intensity of precipitation using reflected radio waves.                                                                                | Acronym                   |
| **Radar Reflectivity**         | A measurement of the amount of energy reflected back to the radar from targets (like rain or hail), indicating precipitation intensity.                                                                                    | Radar Feature             |
| **RFD (Rear Flank Downdraft)** | A region of dry, descending air wrapping around the back side of a mesocyclone, often visible as a clear slot behind the wall cloud.                                                                                       | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
