| **Supercell**                   | A thunderstorm characterized by a persistent rotating updraft (mesocyclone). These are the most dangerous storm types, often producing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds.                     | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Synoptic Scale**              | A large-scale atmospheric pattern, typically involving weather systems spanning 1,000–2,500 km, such as large high and low pressure systems.                                                    | General Meteorology       |
| **Tail-End Charlie**            | Slang for the southernmost storm in a squall line. Often has better inflow and may be more likely to become severe or tornadic.                                                                 | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Thermodynamics**              | The study of relationships between heat and atmospheric properties like pressure, density, and temperature — essential for understanding storm energy and behavior.                             | General Meteorology       |
| **Tornado**                     | A violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground and extending from a thunderstorm.                                                                                                | General Meteorology       |
| **Tornado Family**              | A sequence of tornadoes spawned by a single supercell, typically along the same path.                                                                                                           | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **TVS**                         | *Tornado Vortex Signature* — A radar-indicated signature associated with strong rotation within a storm, potentially signaling a tornado.                                                       | Acronym                   |
| **Triple Point**                | The intersection of three atmospheric boundaries (e.g., cold front, warm front, dryline) and often a prime spot for storm initiation.                                                           | Forecasting Parameter     |
| **Trough**                      | An elongated region of relatively low atmospheric pressure, typically not closed like a low-pressure system. Associated with rising air and often storm development.                            | General Meteorology       |
| **Unstable Air**                | Air that is warmer and less dense than the surrounding environment, encouraging vertical motion and cloud or storm development.                                                                 | General Meteorology       |
| **Updraft**                     | A rising column of air within a storm, driven by buoyant instability or terrain. Crucial for the development of thunderstorms.                                                                  | General Meteorology       |
| **Upper-Air Chart**             | Weather maps depicting conditions in the mid-to-upper atmosphere (usually 850mb and above), used to analyze wind, pressure, and temperature patterns at higher altitudes.                       | Forecasting Tool          |
