| **Vertical Wind Shear** | The change in wind speed and direction with height. A key factor influencing severe thunderstorm and tornado development.                                       | Forecasting Parameter     |
| **Vorticity**           | A measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal plane.                                                                                                       | General Meteorology       |
| **Wall Cloud**          | A localized, persistent lowering from a rain-free cloud base, often seen within several miles of a storm. May exhibit rapid upward motion or cyclonic rotation. | Storm Chasing & Field Ops |
| **Warm Front**          | A boundary where warm air replaces cooler air.                                                                                                                  | General Meteorology       |
| **Warm Sector**         | The region of warm surface air located between an advancing cold front and a warm front. Important in severe weather forecasting.                               | General Meteorology       |
| **WX**                  | Abbreviation for Weather.                                                                                                                                       | Acronym                   |
| **Zonal Flow**          | Large-scale atmospheric flow dominated by east-west winds, with typically weaker north-south (meridional) components.                                           | General Meteorology       |
| **Zulu (Z) Time**       | Another name for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), used as the standard time in meteorology and aviation.                                                       | Acronym                   |
